# Weather Dashboard

This tool can be used to look up the weather in major cities. It saves a search history and will show the last searched city when you open it. If its your first time opening it will show Richmond. I used Erik Flowers' [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
